# Write-ups

This repo is used for me to write up common computer science concepts in simple language. This is a learning 
experiment allowing me and anyone who is gonna read this repo some general info on useful but usually 
niche concepts. Im going to be expanding on this repo everytime I get the chance to do a write up about something.
There isnt a Theme to this repo other then computer science, basically we are going to enjoy the ride and see 
where things get us.
