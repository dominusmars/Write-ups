Classes and Objects

    Class:

        Classes are kindof like isolated contexts within code. They allow you to organize data in 
        a way that it can be changed with functions. They allow developers to develop layers of 
        abstraction in order to conduct certain functions.

        Classes are prototypes of certain objects. For example lets say we want to create a
        car Object. We need to create a class called Car. What does each car have? well it could
        have miles drive, speed, lights, doors, wheels, type of fuel. 

        Classes also contain ways of interacting with the object for example it might have a 
        function that allows you to turn on and off the lights in the car. 

        Why are Classes Important?

            There are many reasons but many developers believe it makes it easier to understand 
            and write code. Classes allow you to spilt up functions into what they do. Classes 
            can also make it easier for a developer to debug code. The functions are spilt up
            in such a way that if something is wrong a develop doesn't need to look through
            the whole code base just to fix it.

    JavaScript Representation:

        class Car{
            name;
            speed;
            miles;
            lights;
            numberOfDoors;
            numberOfWheels;
            typeOfFuel;
            constructor(name,miles, numberOfDoors, numberOfWheels, typeOfFuel){
                this.name = name;
                this.speed = 0;
                this.miles = miles;
                this.lights = false;
                this.numberOfDoors = numberOfDoors;
                this.numberOfWheels;
                this.typeOfFuel = typeOfFuel;
            }
            //getName this type of function is called a getter function. 
            getName(){
                return this.name;
            } 
            //setName this type of function is called a setter function.
            setName(name){
                this.name = name;
            }
            getSpeed(){
                return this.speed;
            }
            setSpeed(speed){
                this.speed = speed;
            }
            getMiles(){
                return this.miles;
            }
            setMiles(miles){
                this.miles = miles;
            }
            getLights(){
                return this.lights;
            }
            toggleLights(){
                this.lights = !this.lights;
            }
            getNumberOfDoors(){
                return this.numberOfDoors;
            }
            getNumberOfWheels(){
                return this.numberOfWheels;
            }
            getTypeOfFuel(){
                return this.typeOfFuel;
            }
        }
